The Merahan Leadership Programme aims to provide student leaders with the skills and opportunities to lead and inspire fellow Merahans. It caters to members of the [1] Prefectorial Board, [2] CCA leaders, and [3] Class Committee Chairpersons.

The Prefectorial Board, comprising students who have displayed leadership dispositions and exemplary behaviour, is a key avenue through which student leaders are given further opportunities to represent their peers and lead in school programmes such as Speech Day and Open House. CCA Leaders go through a diverse range of developmental experiences as they lead their peers in their respective CCAs, while Chairpersons of Class Committees undergo a series of customised learning experiences as they work with their classmates and teachers to create an inviting and positive classroom environment and culture. Major school events such as the Secondary One Orientation Programme and Teachersâ€™ Day Celebrations also provide opportunities for the different groups of Merahan leaders to work together and play their part in the planning and implementation of authentic and meaningful projects.

## Peer Support Lifter (PSL) Programme

Peer Support Lifters, or PSLs, play an important role in developing a caring and inclusive culture of peer support in class and in the school. They provide an additional layer of timely support and help elevate the culture of peer support. The presence of PSLs provides an avenue for connection between students, and between students and supporting adults, to meet the needs of Merahans.

The PSL programme in BMSS develops PSLs through the stages of [1] Novice, [2] Junior, and [3] Senior PSLs (as illustrated in the workshop topic coverage in the table below). For Novice PSLs, knowledge of the concepts of peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing are deepened through interactive workshops, with subsequent opportunities to apply and hone their skills authentically within their respective classes. Junior PSLs continue to deepen their knowledge as a community, and make a difference to the overall experience of school life through projects to bring classmates together. Senior PSLs go a step further to support other PSLs in their journey. PSLs have a voice in determining how far they would like to progress along the stages of Junior and Senior PSLs, depending on the personal readiness and aspiration of the PSLs.

Every student in BMSS will go through the Aesthetic Education Programme (AEP). It aims to develop appreciation and interest in visual and performing arts in students, to provide students with opportunity for authentic learning and skills building on their chosen aesthetics area and to build up studentsâ€™ self confidence & maximise their talents.

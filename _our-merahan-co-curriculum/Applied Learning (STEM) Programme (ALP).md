### Applied Learning (STEM) Programme (ALP)

Bukit Merah Secondary School's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) of "Creative Robotics and Engineering" offers a dynamic two-year STEM experience in the contextual theme of Emerging Technologies for all Merahans. The programme incorporates the Design Thinking (DT) methodology and problem-based learning to create a user-centric approach that focuses on the practical applications of robotics and engineering in solving real-world problems. Its overarching goal is to inspire inventiveness and develop critical thinking skills in students.

There are tiers to this ALP Programme. 

#### BMSS Tier 1 ALP

Tier 1 is open to all secondary 1 and 2 students. The programme offers unique challenges and opportunities for all. 

In the Secondary One programme, students are introduced to the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning through coding activities using the Micro:bit. Through a series of tasks and mini-projects that involve visual and vocal recognition, students can explore these emerging technologies and gain a better understanding of its potential applications.

In the Secondary Two programme, students are further challenged to apply their knowledge of AI and Machine Learning, as well as the principles of Design Thinking, to solve simulated real-life problems. Working in groups, students design and create prototypes to address practical issues while incorporating the skills and knowledge they acquired in the previous year.

#### BMSS Tier 2 ALP

This tier is for students who exhibit a particular interest or aptitude in coding and engineering and it offers a platform to showcase their talents. The Engineering &amp; Innovation Club (E&amp;I), being the anchor Tier 2 co-curricular activities (CCA) club, allows students to challenge themselves in various STEM-related competitions both locally and internationally, where they have consistently outperformed their peers and emerged as winners.

Through the ALP programme, Bukit Merah Secondary School aims to provide students with the tools and skills necessary to be inventive and critical thinkers, ensuring they are well-equipped to thrive in the rapidly evolving 21st century.

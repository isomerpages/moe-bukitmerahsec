###  Introduction to Buddy Reading Programme 

As part of the Reading Programme, the Secondary 3 Reading Ambassadors and their buddies participate in the Buddy Reading Programme. The Reading Ambassadors guide their buddies by coaching them with customised materials like comic strips, visual texts and songs. The Reading Ambassadors will also work with their buddies to create comic strips or posters which centred around one of the school values. They all love that they could be creative in applying what they have learnt from the Buddy Reading Programme.

“We enjoyed the buddy reading project because we learned that language is applicable in our daily lives. During the sessions, we helped each other to better understand the comic strips and learned new vocabulary words. It was fun to express our creativity and create our own story”.

### Learning for Life (Sports) Programme (LLP) 

#### Character Development Through Sports

The LLP committee brought together the best of the two merged schools’ LLP programmes and arrived at a new theme “Character Development Through Sports” in 2021 after walking through the merger years.

The revised LLP structure is as follows:

Aligning our programmes based on the school values of Respect, Integrity, Self-Discipline & Empathy (RISE), the TLLP will be implemented through three main platforms as a broad-based approach for Merahans:

*   Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons
    *   Teaching of our school values in line with the CCE curriculum
*   Key School Developmental Experiences:
    *   All Merahans will have opportunities for character building experiences through the various school-wide initiatives.
    *   Merahan Olympics Day: Whole School Inter House Games
    *   Sports Education Program: All Sec 1 & 3 students & UG Cadets
    *   Outdoor Cohort Camps.
    *   Sporting Activities within every CCA.
*   Physical Education (PE) Lessons
    *   Using the Sports Education Model to structure our PE lessons, students are put into positions of responsibilities by assuming different roles through the game seasons.
    *   This is on top of students’ development in playing competencies and sporting skills.

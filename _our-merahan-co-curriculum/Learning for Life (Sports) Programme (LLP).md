### Learning for Life (Sports) Programme (LLP) 

#### Character Development Through Sports

The future of Singapore is being shaped by key driving forces such as globalization, changing demographics in society, and technological advancements, which have been hastened by the Covid-19 pandemic. These challenges are volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, and our Merahans must be prepared to face them and adapt where necessary.  

To equip our Merahans with a steadfast moral compass in this dynamic world, Bukit Merah Secondary School (BMSS) has developed the Learning For Life Programme (LLP) which focuses on Character Development through Sports. This programme aims to develop in our students, the school values of Respect, Integrity, Self-Discipline, and Empathy. 

Through the LLP Programme, students will have multiple platforms to develop and enact these core values through authentic learning experiences within the sporting context. This will enable them to apply these values in realistic and real-world situations. 

For students who are passionate about pursuing Sports-related excellence, BMSS offers an exciting opportunity for them to join the Sports CCAs (Basketball, Floorball &amp; Tchoukball) through the Direct School Admission (DSA) programme. These Sports CCAs provide students with a wide range of opportunities to develop both their character and sporting competencies such as teamwork through the National School Games, external competitions, and outreach programmes. 

At BMSS, we firmly believe that our LLP programme and Sports CCAs offer a holistic platform for students enrolled via DSA (Sports) to develop their sportsmanship, hone their skills, and achieve their potential in the sporting domains.


##### Learning For Life  Programme (LLP)

To equip our Merahans with a steadfast moral compass in this dynamic world, Bukit Merah Secondary School (BMSS) developed the Learning For Life Programme (LLP) which focuses on Character Development through Sports. This programme aims to develop in our students, the school values of Respect, Integrity, Self-Discipline, and Empathy though authentic sporting experiences.

Through the LLP Programme, students will have multiple platforms to develop and enact these core values through learning experiences within the sporting context. This will enable them to apply these values in realistic and real-world situations. 

There are two tiers to our LLP Programme.

##### BMSS Tier 1 LLP
Tier 1 is open to all secondary students through difference sporting experiences. The programme offers unique experiences and opportunities for all.

In the Secondary One &amp; Two Sports-For-All programme (SfA), the School RISE Values are infused into Sec 1 &amp; 2 Physical Education Curriculum and taught through the Sidentop Sports Education Model. Students undergo journaling to reflect on their exhibition of these values during practical applications guided by the PE Teachers.  At the end of the curriculum, students do a self-reporting of the values learnt to reflect on their character development journey.

The Secondary One &amp; Two Sports Education Programme (SEP), the school provides sports exposure for all Secondary One &amp; Two students to sports that are not traditionally offered in the PE curriculum or CCA, for example, Bowling, Kayaking &amp;  Golfing Exposure. All Lower Secondary students undergo a 1-day SEP programme with emphasis on the RISE Values during briefing and debriefing done by the vendors and teachers.

Lastly, the school organises two Whole School LLP Events; Merahan Olympics Day (Intra-Class Games) and Heart &amp; Sole Challenge (Cross Country) which are annual sporting events for all students to compete across the level against other classes. These full-school events serve as platform for students to exhibit the values of Respect, Integrity, Self-Discipline and Empathy as they compete against others in various sports as well as challenge themselves individually during the cross-country event.

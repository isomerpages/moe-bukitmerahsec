### GMP – Srinagarindra the Princess Mother School Phayao, Thailand

We visited our twinning school, Srinagarindra the Princess Mother School Phayao, Thailand from 10th to 15th November.

**Day 1 @ Chiang Rai (10th Nov 2018)**

Our Merahans arrived in Chiang Rai to a very warm welcome by the Vice-Principal of Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother School. This was followed by a brief introduction to the origins of Chiang Rai.

One of the key highlights of the day was a visit to the Singha Park where the students had an enriching learning experience at the 3,000 acre farm.

**Day 2 @ Chiang Rai (11th Nov 2018)**

History and Geography lessons came alive for our Merahans today, particularly during the visit to the Golden Triangle where they stood at the point where the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos met, and when they learnt about the impact of opium on Thailand and the region at the Hall of Opium.

At the northernmost part of Thailand, our students were able to look across the river to see Myanmar. The visit to the Long Neck Karen hill tribe and the Blue Temple topped off a truly educational day.

**Day 3 @ Phayao (12 Nov 2018)**

Merahans arrived to a warm welcome by Principal, staff and students at Sringarindra, the Princess Mother School in Phayao. The students went through a day of lessons with a difference starting with a Thai handwriting lesson where they learnt the Thai alphabet and how to write their names in Thai. They then learnt how to make a northern sky lantern and Krathong (decorated float) in preparation for the Loy Krathong festival.

In the afternoon, the students donned rubber boots and armed themselves with sickles to harvest rice. The day ended with Merahans sharing cultural highlights about Singapore to a classroom of students.

**Day 4 @ Phayao (13 Nov 2018)**

It was another exciting and activity-filled day as Merahans embarked on their Values in Action project at Ban Rong Por School. Other than teaching simple English and Maths to the primary school children, our students also decorated a classroom and spruced up the playground.

The evening was spent in the delightful company of their Thai buddies and partaking in a very special Khantoke dinner filled with Thai cultural performances as well as our very own performance.

To top off the evening, students released the Krathong and northern sky lanterns they had made the previous day. It was a truly magical end to the day.

**Day 5 @ Phayao / Chiang Rai (14 Nov 2018)**

We bid a fond farewell to our generous hosts from SWPY this morning. SWPY and BMSS staff and students exchanged gifts and well wishes as they said their last goodbyes to each other. The friendships forged and memories made over the last two days will always be greatly treasured.

The afternoon was well-spent exploring key attractions in Chiang Rai which included the White Temple and the King Muang Rai monument.

**Day 6 @ Chiang Rai (15 Nov 2018)**

Before boarding the plane back home, Merahans visited the wall mural honouring the rescue operation that saved 12 young footballers and their coach who were trapped in a cave for more than two weeks.

They then said goodbye to their guide, and beautiful Chiang Rai, taking with them  
many warm memories and unforgettable experiences.

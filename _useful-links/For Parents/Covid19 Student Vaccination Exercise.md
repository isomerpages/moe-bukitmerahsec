### COVID-19 Student Vaccination Exercise

Dear Parents,

As part of the national vaccination exercise, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be rolling out vaccination to more groups, and will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to progressively cover over 400,000 students from schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) from 1 June 2021.

In Drama Club, students build confidence, creativity, and character through dynamic training sessions. Each activity is designed to develop Resilient, Caring, and Self-Directed Learners, in line with our RISE values and school motto Sedia.
Through our training, students grow as expressive performers and responsible team players through:

*	Acting – building confidence, expression and stagecraft
*	Vocal Training – voice projection, articulation and emotional delivery
* Movement – body awareness, coordination and stage presence
* Script Writing – storytelling, creativity and collaboration
* Theatre Improvisation – quick thinking, adaptability and courage
* Drama Games – teamwork, communication and trust-building
* Drama Exercises – sharpening performance techniques and discipline
* Physical Training – stamina, focus and resilience

In every session, students are encouraged to step out of their comfort zones, support one another, and take ownership of their growth, preparing them to shine on stage and beyond.
Join us and step into the spotlight. Discover the best version of you. 😊

**Head Prefect Message**

2021 has been a meaningful year for the BMSS Prefectorial Board. Despite the challenges posed by Covid-19, the school has continued to provide the Prefectorial Board with platforms to allow us to lead, learn and grow. We have also been equipped with facilitation and communication skills. In order to allow us to put into practice these skills, we have been given the opportunity to be involved in the school’s SPLT (Students. Play. Lead. inTeract) activities. Each week, we are rostered to engage our peers in different in-class and out-of class activities. This platform has allowed us to hone our leadership skills, foster closer bonds with our peers as well as gain confidence. Another initiative we have taken charge of is the Online Student Suggestion Scheme. Besides publicising about the scheme, we help to shortlist suggestions from our peers. These suggestions are then forwarded to the school’s management for their consideration.

We are grateful for these leadership experiences and will strive to be positive role models who uphold the school’s core values. We hope the perfects will be a positive influence to help the Merahans to grow, to have humility and to display the attributes of a good role model to everyone. Just as John C. Maxwell has mentioned before, “leaders who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way”, I hope all prefects, inluding me, will be inspired and motivated to become such leaders. – Natalie Chow

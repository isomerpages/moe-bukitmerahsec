**Direct School Admission**

The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004 to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.  Under this DSA-Sec Exercise, participating schools will be able to select some Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released.

For more information, please visit [**http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec**](http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)

**School Vision** 

Our vision is “Every Merahan a resilient, caring and self-directed learner”. We believe that the sporting arena provides an authentic learning experience for our students to develop the values of Resilience, Integrity, Self-Discipline and Empathy as envisioned by our school.

**Reflections from Current and Ex-BMSS students**

|---|---|
| <img src="/images/cca32.png" style="width:90%"> | Navin s/o Kumaran (2018)<br>2018 – School Team Champion & National ChampionI was formerly from band in primary school and I wasn’t that vocal, confident and outspoken. After picking up floorball in secondary one, I started gaining confidence to be more vocal and outspoken. I was also offered the captain role in secondary 2 and this shaped me to become a leader who is vocal and driven to win matches. However, we didn’t have a good run in that season. In secondary 4, I got another shot at being the captain and I corrected myself on my previous mistakes I made as a captain. With floorball constantly boosting my confidence during the past 4 years, I became way more vocal, confident, resilient and self-disciplined this year. |
|  <img src="/images/cca33.png" style="width:90%"> | Siti Nurhaliza Binte Khairul Anuar (2015)<br>2021 – Singapore National Floorball Player<br>2019 to 2020 – Played for Czech Republic’s top-tier club SC Tempish VitkoviceI am glad to have played for the BMSS Floorball Girls’ Team. Through the many sporting and academic challenges & achievements here in BMSS, I was able to use it to help me pursue a Diploma in Sports and Exercise Sciences via the direct polytechnic admission programme (DPA) at Republic Polytechnic. |
|  <img src="/images/cca34.png" style="width:90%"> | Mohamad Rashid Bin Jalaluddin (2008)<br>2022 – BMSS Boys Coach<br>2018 – Singapore National Floorball Player<br>Floorball has developed a ‘never say die’ attitude in me. The experiences of the numerous victories and failures throughout my floorball career has proven to me that if I pursue what I want to achieve and put in my maximum effort, the results will eventually show. It’s definitely a principle that stuck with me through my daily lives.<br>Floorball has also taught me to adapt to different situations and make quick decisions. Being a very tactical game, there are many instances where there is a need to change decisions on court to shift the game momentum to our advantage. Similarly in our daily lives not everything will go according to plan and there is a need to adapt or make changes.<br>  |
| <img src="/images/cca35.png" style="width:90%"> | Nurul Shakira Bte Zainal (2019)<br>2016 to 2019 – Basketball Player<br> Through the Basketball CCA, I learnt that no matter how tough my opponents are, I must try my best not to give up until the end of the game. I learnt that communication, teamwork and self-awareness are important in a game because it sets the tone on both sides of the court and on how I want to push myself to play my best in the game.  These are important qualities to being a good basketball player.  I go by this motto and hope to inspire the future of BMSS Basketball players, “Be the best version of yourself in anything that you do”. |
| <img src="/images/cca36.png" style="width:90%"> | Leona Yoong (2018)<br>2018 – Basketball Girls’ Vice-Captain<br>I joined the Basketball CCA without really understanding what I was going to achieve. Being in the basketball CCA has nurtured me into a self-disciplined and responsible individual.  It taught me values that could be applied both on and off the court.  It made me understand the importance of teamwork, hard work and perseverance. Through these, it gave me a goal to work towards and to focus on.<br>I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to lead as the Vice-Captain of my team. The chance to lead and guide my team through the trainings and games has allowed me to become more self-directed and empathetic towards helping my peers and juniors in the game. The setbacks and experiences always made me self-reflect to correct my mistakes and overcome my shortcomings so that I would become a stronger and better player.  My achievements will not be possible if not for my teachers’ and coach’s dedication and guidance. |
| <img src="/images/cca37.png" style="width:90%"> | Adrian Then (2017)<br>2017 – Basketball Boys’ Vice-Captain<br>Discipline. Leadership. Teamwork. These are essentially the main 3 takeaways during my journey in the Basketball CCA.  All the blood, sweat and tears my teammates and I had gone through over the course of my 5 years in the school, enriched me with the best experiences that are precious to me.  From running laps around the court, to sweet twilight camp moments, I will not forget these memories. I am blessed with the most hardworking and caring teachers who constantly go the extra mile, just to see the smiles on our faces. Without these experiences I had in Basketball CCA, I definitely would not have become who I am today. |
| <img src="/images/cca38.png" style="width:90%"> | Nina Qareenah Binte Razalee (2021)<br>2018 to 2021 – Tchoukball Player<br>2021 – Captain of B Division Team<br>I am glad and felt honoured when my teacher-in-charge chose me to be the Captain of the C Division Team when I was in Secondary 1 as I knew that I can contribute to the CCA. I was happy that I could help my Tchoukball teammates and go through a lot of challenges with them. We had to go through vigorous training sessions but the friendships and bond forged during these sessions helped me get through each challenging time. I am proud to be a Tchoukball player because of the self-discipline and respect that I have learnt in my CCA. I am always grateful to my teammates and teachers for trusting me with their sincere heart. |
| <img src="/images/cca39.png" style="width:90%"> | Koh Wan Ting (2021)<br>2018 to 2021 – Tchoukball Player<br>2021 – Vice-Captain of B Division TeamI am sincerely honoured to be part of the Tchoukball CCA. I am always excited to attend CCA sessions as I can play games and train with my teammates and have an enjoyable time together. When I first started training in Tchoukball CCA, I found it tough and tiring to do the drills and exercises. However, as time passed by, I realised my stamina improved and I overcame the tiredness, I also became more resilient and self-disciplined. Given the opportunity to be the Vice-Captain was something I never expected. It gave me the chance to get to know my teammates better and learn how to work together with others. I really want to thank my teachers and coach for trusting me to lead the juniors and guide them. |

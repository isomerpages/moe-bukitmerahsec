**Mission**

The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

This is achieved by:

*   involving them throughout their formative years in a non-formal educational process
*   using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent of his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person
*   assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Scouts Promise and Law

**Vision**

Better Scouting For More Young People

**History**

Scouting was first introduced to the students of Bukit Merah Secondary School in 1969 as Eagles Scouts. In 2002, Eagles Scouts and Spider Scouts from New Town Secondary School combined as one and was named as Eagles Scout Troop. In 2005, it was renamed as 23 Eagles Scout Troop (“23” came from the past unit number) to avoid confusion with other Eagles Scout Units. In the same year, NUS High School joined the troop.

<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools
and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital
literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the
Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school
students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>

<h4>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) in BMSS</h4>
<p><strong><u>Objectives</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With 1 to 1 tech-enabled learning, to create a&nbsp;student-centric,&nbsp;engaging&nbsp;and&nbsp;stimulating&nbsp;teaching
and learning environment which encourages Merahans to:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>take&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;of their learning,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>participate in&nbsp;collaborative&nbsp;learning and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend their learning&nbsp;beyond the classroom</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>School-Prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Every new Merahan in 2026 will be using the Acer TravelMate Spin B3 as
their personal learning device.
<br>
</p>
<p>Acer TravelMate is a portable device that offers students convenient learning
on-the-move, it also allows for a seamless learning experience alongside
existing learning technologies such as the Student Learning Space (SLS),
Google Suite and Microsoft Office. The touch screen and inking function
makes it the device of choice in developing students’ application and creative
skills.

<h4>ICT Applications as part of National Digital Literacy Programme</h4>
<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
<br>As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out ICT applications
that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey.
<br>
</p>
<p>The school will need to use your child/ward’s personal data such as his/her
name and class to set up user accounts.
<br>
</p>
<p>Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information
on the collection of data via these applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>ICT Applications</u></strong>
<br>In the following months, MOE will roll out some or all of the following
applications:
<br>
<br><strong>Student ICON  - </strong>MOE will give every secondary school
student an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part
of Google Suite.
<br>
<br><strong>Microsoft 365 Pro Plus - </strong>Every Secondary School will
be granted a license to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint
and Excel.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Device Management Application (DMA)</h4>
<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong>
<br>Please note that when you purchase a PLD, the PLD will be pre-installed
with a Device Management Application (DMA). The DMA has a variety of functions
that will support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard
students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA can:
<br>
</p>
<p>• Remotely deploy teaching and learning applications as well as security
patches
<br>• Enable teachers to monitor and control the students’ screens
<br>• Restrict apps and websites accessible
<br>• Limit screen time</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Classroom Management</u></strong>
<br>Teachers are able to actively monitor and control the student’s use of
the PLD during lesson time to help student better manage distractions and
deliver effective teaching.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Mobile Device Management</u></strong>
<br>Remote deployment of teaching and learning applications as well as security
patches is made possible with DMA. Schools may also leverage on the Mobile
Device Management Service to install the school’s teaching and learning
resources.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Usage Management</u></strong>
<br>This addresses stress to the student’s eyes from prolonged use and cyber
wellness concerns, such as excessive and inappropriate use of the PLD.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Updating Choice of After-School DMA Option</u></strong>
<br>Choice of after-school DMA settings can be changed at any time using the
following link.
<br>
<br>Do note that changes to the after-school DMA option will only take effect
at&nbsp;<strong>the end of every month upon receipt of request before the 15th of each month.</strong>&nbsp;An
email confirmation will be sent to confirm the updated after-school DMA
option once it has been activated.
<br>
<br>Request made after the 15th of each month will only take effect the following
month.

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How will my child/ward's data be used in DMA?</p>
<p>The Device Management Application (DMA) which will be installed in your
child/ward’s PLD collects data on usage by the student, such as the amount
of time spent on each application. The DMA data will only be used for MOE’s
cyber-wellness measures and technical troubleshooting. MOE will not disclose
the data to any person otherwise than permitted under the law.</p>

</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Where will the data collected by DMA and IT Applications for NDLP be stored?</p>
<p>All user data which is collected by MOE will be stored in secure servers
managed by the respective vendors of our systems. The Government has put

<p>How will my child/ward's data be used in the ICT Applications?</p>
<p>For the ICT Applications (student iCON, Microsoft ProPlus), the school
will use your child/ward’s personal data such as his/her name, birth certificate
number and class to set up user accounts. This data will also be used for
the purposes of authenticating and verifying user identity, troubleshooting
and facilitating system improvements. In addition, the commercial providers

<p>Where can I find the full terms of purchase of the PLD?</p>
<p>Parents/guardians will be purchasing the PLD directly from the vendor,
not MOE. This is pursuant to a bulk tender agreement between MOE and the
vendor. The tender documents set out the full terms and conditions of such
a purchase, and can be found at this website:&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/pldtermsandconditions" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/pldtermsandconditions</a>

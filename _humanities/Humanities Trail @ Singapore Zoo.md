### Humanities Trail @ Singapore Zoo

The HumanitiesTrail@ Singapore Zoo is one of the Humanities Departments’ signature programmes. It aimed to provide an authentic experience for graduating students to apply their skills in a real world environment that is visually engaging, informative and interactive . The programme also served to build bonds between teachers and students as they enjoyed a morning walk within the Singapore Zoo, applying their skills and learning about the animals.

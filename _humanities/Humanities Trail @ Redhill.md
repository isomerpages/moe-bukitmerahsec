### Humanities Trail @ Redhill

The Merahan Trail has been uniquely designed by the Humanities Department for  students to develop their knowledge, skills and appreciate the values in the Social Studies, History and Geography curriculum. Incorporating ICT in the Trail, Merahans are able to discover information on sites of economic, religious and social significance located within the vicinity of the school in a fun and engaging manner through the use of iPads.

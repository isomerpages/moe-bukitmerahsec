### Humanities Week 2019

In Term 1 Week 9, Bukit Merah Secondary School ran a Humanities Week centered around Singapore. Merahans of all levels enjoyed Humanities Week which was kicked off with an entertaining and informative skit about Singaporeâ€™s colourful History. Learning Journeys, trails and quizzes helped Merahans spark their interest and love for Humanities before we engaged in a breathtaking Humanities Challenge Grand Finals, featuring two Upper Secondary Teams competing for the inaugural Humanities Challenge Champion Team.

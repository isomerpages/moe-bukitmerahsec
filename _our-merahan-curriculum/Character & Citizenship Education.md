<h4><strong>PREPARING OUR STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE EMERGING 21ST CENTURY COMPETENCIES (E21CC) @ BMSS:</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><u>Overview of E21CC:</u></strong></h4>
<p>At Bukit Merah Secondary School (BMSS), we are committed to nurturing
Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC) in our students. These competencies
equip Merahans with the skills, values, and dispositions needed to navigate
the challenges of the future. Building upon the foundation of five social-emotional
competencies (Self Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship
Management, and Responsible Decision-Making), our school is committed to
fostering students to be confident, empathetic, and motivated lifelong
learners.</p>
<p>The E21CC are categorized into three key domains, with each domain further
detailed to identify the specific observable and actionable skills and
dispositions that we aim for our students to demonstrate within the BMSS
context.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Co-Curriculum</strong>: Our
extensive range of co-curricular activities, leadership development programmes
and Values-in-Action projects provide practical platforms for students
to apply and refine their 21st century competencies in real-world contexts.</p>

experiences.</p>

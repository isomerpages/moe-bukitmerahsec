**Department Vision**

The English language programme aims to enable students to become:

* Empathize and confident communicators
* Discerning readers
* Creative inquirers

**Department Details**

The Bukit Merah English Language programme aims to nurture Merahans to be empathetic and confident users of the English Language, discerning readers and creative inquirers through three main areas, namely :

1\.  Cultivating the love of reading through a structured programme and exposure to different genres of writing.<br>
2.  Promoting the student voice through EN-ELT (Enhancing English Learning and Teaching) strategies and alternative assessments.<br>
3.  Nurturing students to become independent and self-directed learners by encouraging them to manage their own learning.

To further this aim, the Bukit Merah English Literature programme strives to instil a love for the written word and an appreciation for how literature is relevant to the life by allowing students to read a diverse range of prose, poetic and dramatic Literature texts, carefully selected to pique their interest, encourage personal response and stimulate higher-order thinking.

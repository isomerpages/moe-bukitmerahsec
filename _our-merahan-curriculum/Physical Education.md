**Programmes**

* CCA Orientation

    * The Secondary 1 CCA Orientation is an annual event conducted for the Sec 1 students.
    * It serves as a good platform for Secondary 1 students and their parents to get to know the various CCAs offered by the school.

* Heart x Sole Challenge (Cross Country):
     * Cross Country is organised annually to inculcate resilience and outdoor appreciation through long distance running. It is a 2-in-1 event where  students participate in
     
     * Cross Country Running
     * NAPFA 2.4 km Running Test for the Secondary 2, 4 and 5 levels
       
     * We have held our event at places like Japanese Garden, Jurong Central Park and Jurong Lake Gardens.

* Merahan Olympics:

   * The Merahan Olympics is our annual Inter-Class Games Day. Students participate in a wide range of sports such as Basketball, Floorball, Football, Netball, Ultimate Frisbee and Badminton.

* DARE Programme:

   * The objective of the programme is to equip students with CPR/AED skills from a young age. Through this, safety awareness among students is heightened and they gain the confidence to respond to a cardiac arrest. It also provides an opportunity to inculcate 21st Century Competencies traits in students and reinforce their commitment to lead a healthy lifestyle.
 
  * Lessons are held during Health Week and teaching tools such as a half body mannequin and mock AED machines are used to make the learning as authentic as possible.
  
  * As of 2018, our entire student population has gone through this programme.

* Outdoor Education (OE):
     * Our lower secondary students have embarked on OE lessons since 2017.
     * Our lessons focus on basic orienteering skills, knots tying, tent pitching and outdoor cooking.
      Students get to apply the skills and knowledge that they have obtained in their level and Uniform Group camps.

* Sports Education Programme (SEP):

  * The department organises SEP as part of the post-examination activities for Secondary 1 to 2 students.
   * Merahans have gone through programmes such as Bowling, Golf, Rock Climbing, Archery and Dragonboating.


* Inter-class challenge system

     * As part of post covid reforms, the house system was phased out as we geared towards focusing on classroom identities as part of the preparation for FSBB where every class has a good mix of students from different streams. This achieves the desired interaction coupled with the opportunities for cross-level interactions from CCA and school-wide events. As such, every Merahan is strongly encouraged to do their best for class-based activities, which provides stronger sense of identity, peer relations and sense of belonging.

*    Swimming Programme:
        *   At the end of their lower secondary years in the school, all Merahans would have gone through the SwimSafer 2.0 Programme.

Through this, safety awareness among students is heightened and they gain the confidence to respond to&nbsp;a cardiac arrest. It also provides an opportunity to inculcate&nbsp;21st&nbsp;Century Competencies traits in students and reinforce their commitment to lead a healthy lifestyle.
        *   Lessons are held during Health Week and teaching tools such as a half body mannequin and mock AED machines are used to make the learning as authentic as possible.

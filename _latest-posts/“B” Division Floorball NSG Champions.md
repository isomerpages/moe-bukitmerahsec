### “B” Division Floorball NSG Champions 

Our Merahan ‘B’ division Floorball boys have reclaimed the championship title! 🏆

After two years of hiatus, the National School Games are back in full swing this year and our floorball boys proved that they have been keeping up with their training as they emerged with a 4-3 victory after a gruelling match. Well done boys! 🥳

If you’ve tuned on ActiveSG to support our boys, you’ll know how hard they fought. We are all very proud of you! Majulah Merahans! W for the win!

##### School Advisory Committee (SAC)

<img src="/images/sac1000.jpg" style="width:50,align:left"> 

Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) is made up of members from the education, business, social and community sectors. Currently, 3 of our members – Mr Goh Kia Hong, Mr Andy Chew and Mrs Gina Tan – are alumni who have returned to contribute to the school that has played a part in nurturing them to be who they are today.

The functions of the SAC are to:

(a)	advise the school on the strategic directions within MOE’s policy framework;

(b)	garner support for the school from stakeholders and the community to achieve positive student learning outcomes, in line with the national educational goals and objectives; and

(c)	raise funds for carrying out activities and programmes that contribute to the holistic development of the students.

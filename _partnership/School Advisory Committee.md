Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) is made up of members from the education, business, social and community sectors. Currently, 5 of our members – Mr Goh Kia Hong, Mr Andy Chew, Mrs Gina Tan, Mr Tan Teck Lee and Mr Teo Soon Kwan Elisha Peterson – are alumni who have returned to contribute to the school that has played a part in nurturing them to be who they are today

The functions of the SAC are to:

(a)	advise the school on the strategic directions within MOE’s policy framework;

(b)	garner support for the school from stakeholders and the community to achieve positive student learning outcomes, in line with the national educational goals and objectives; and

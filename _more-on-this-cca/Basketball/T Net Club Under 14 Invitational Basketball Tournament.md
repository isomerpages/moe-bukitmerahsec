### T Net Club Under 14 Invitational Basketball Tournament 

During the June holidays, our C Division girls’ and boys’ basketball teams played in the annual T-Net Club Under-14 Invitational Basketball Tournament organised by T-Net Club@Bukit Merah and Bukit Merah Secondary School. The tournament saw the participation of 16 boys’ teams and 16 girls’ teams from Singapore schools.

Both our teams gave it their best shot and gained much experience from this tournament as they faced various difficulties and learnt to overcome them in preparation for the upcoming South Zone C Division Basketball Championship. Our girls performed particularly well and finished first in their category.

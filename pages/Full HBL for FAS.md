**Extension of School Meal Subsidies to Students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) During Full Home-Based Learning (FHBL) Period**

To provide added support for all primary and secondary students on MOE FAS during this circuit breaker period, MOE, with support from the Sayang Sayang Fund launched by the Community Foundation of Singapore, will now extend meal subsidies to these students regardless of whether they return to school during full HBL.

This provision will apply for a period of four weeks, covering the full HBL period from 8 April to 4 May 2020.

MOE will disburse the school meal subsidies via two top-ups to eligible students’ School Smartcard. With the extension of MOE’s school meal subsidies, secondary school students on MOE FAS will receive a total of $120 each. This subsidy amount is similar to the amount students on MOE FAS would have received if there were lessons going on as usual in school.

The School Smartcard can be used to purchase food and essential groceries at some hawker centres, food courts, minimarts, convenience stores and supermarkets. Students can redeem the extended meal subsidies at any TransitLink Add Value Machine2 once every two weeks, starting from 14 April 2020.

###  Introduction to Buddy Reading Programme 

As part of the Reading Programme, the Secondary 3 Reading Ambassadors and their buddies participated in the Buddy Reading Programme. The Reading Ambassadors guided their buddies by coaching them with customised materials like comic strips, visual texts and songs. The Reading Ambassadors worked with their buddies to create comic strips or posters which centred around one of the school values. They all loved that they could be creative in applying what they had learnt from the Buddy Reading Programme.

“We enjoyed the buddy reading project because we learned that language is applicable in our daily lives. During the sessions, we helped each other to better understand the comic strips and learned new vocabulary words. It was fun to express our creativity and create our own story”.

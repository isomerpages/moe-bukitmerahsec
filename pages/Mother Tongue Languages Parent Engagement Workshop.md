With the objective of partnering parents in preparing students for the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) national examinations, the MTL department conducted a parent engagement workshop on strengthening students’ oral competency in Chinese, Malay and Tamil on 20 Jan 2018 in the school.

General information on the national examinations, components of oral communication and strategies on strengthening students’ oral competency were shared during the one-and-a-half hour workshops which 45 parents attended. Parents were engaged and questions were asked during  the Question & Answer session. All parents gave the feedback that the information provided during the workshop was adequate and useful and that they would like to attend future workshops that relate to students’ academic progress.

**Provision of Meals Subsidies for Students on MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) during Extended Circuit Breaker Period**

The Circuit Breaker period is now extended by another 4 weeks to 1 June 2020, and the mid-year school break will be advanced to May. Typically, meal subsidies are not provided during school holidays. However, given the exceptional circumstances this year, together with the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), MOE has decided to continue providing meal subsidies through School Smartcard top-ups during this mid-year holidays. This is on top of the provision of school meal subsidies that MOE and the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) had provided earlier, in the form of School Smartcard top-ups to all Primary and Secondary students from low income families during the period of Full Home-Based Learning.

The School Smartcard can be used for payment at 146 hawker centres and coffee shops (stalls that accept payment using this Smartcard will display the EZ-Link logo), plus certain convenience stores and supermarkets. (_pls refer to the link below for the list of suggested merchants_)

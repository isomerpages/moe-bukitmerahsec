### School Song

 <img src="/images/songpattern.png" style="width:80%">  
 
<figure> Youthful spirits are high and bright

BMSS is known far and wide

Tirelessly the teachers show the way

So firm, so loving, so sure to inspire

In school, no race nor creed that matters

We mix, we play like brothers and sisters

Wisdom, virtue, fortitude

Must not be found lacking

Our love for our country, constant, everlasting

Drum up our courage and spirits

Service to our community

Be loyal to our country

Be this our aim, be this our glory! </figure>

### School History

Bukit Merah Secondary School (BMSS) was the 101st school built by the government. It was completed and handed over to the Ministry of Education on 28th December 1967.

The school received its first batch of students on 4th January 1968 and was officially declared open by the Minister of Parliament of Bukit Merah, Mr Lim Guan Hoo, on 16th May 1968.

As the Bukit Merah neighbourhood evolved, BMSS too, underwent several significant changes while continuing to be an institution that prides itself on cultivating a caring environment and establishing positive expectations to bring out the best in students.

In 2001, St. Thomas Secondary School merged with BMSS and the old school building was demolished to make way for a new campus with better facilities that would cater to the growing school population. In 2004, Delta Secondary School merged with BMSS. In the same year, the new school building at Lengkok Bahru was officially declared open by Mr Chay Wai Chuen, the Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC. The following year, a new vision and mission statement was crafted for the school to better reflect its identity following the mergers.

Most recently in 2017, Henderson Secondary School (HSS) and BMSS were merged into a single school to give the new BMSS strategic depth and to allow for a wider range of educational and enrichment programmes for students. The school continues to be known as Bukit Merah Secondary School in English, while adopting HSS’ Chinese name—达善中学, in order to reflect the amalgamation of the strengths and heritage of both schools.

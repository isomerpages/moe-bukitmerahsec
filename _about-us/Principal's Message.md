<p>The Singapore education system made headlines when our 15-year-old students
outperformed their counterparts in 80 other participating system in Reading,
Mathematics and Science to emerge top for the 2022 Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA). Surprisingly, as part of PISA, our students
were also top in creative thinking, beating their peers from over 60 other
countries. While such achievements affirm the efforts of our system, they
do not detract each school from the continuous efforts to develop our students
holistically, beyond academic outcomes. In BM, our vision is to nurture
our Merahans to be Resilient, Caring and Self-directed Learners, anchored
in our school values -- Respect, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy
(RISE), so they can contribute and make a difference in the community we
are in</p>
<p>If I were to sum up BM in three phrases, it will be as follows:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A school of Character</strong>.
Academic progression is important for Merahans but it alone does not define
their past, present and future. What is equally important is to anchor
our Merahans in good values so they can make informed and responsible decisions.
In BM, we endeavour to develop Merahans to RISE up to every occasion and
to consider not just themselves but the others around them. We are grateful
to the parents, partners and members of the public who affirmed Merahans
for their public spiritedness and conduct within and outside of the school.
We certainly hope our Merahans can continue to do what is right for years
to come.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A school of Hearts</strong>. A trademark
of our school is our strong and positive culture of care among students,
staff and between students and staff. Regular opportunities are established
to grow and deepen the relationships that perpetuate the culture. The commitment
and dedication of our mission-driven staff, many of whom have served in
the school for decades, is a strong anchor to sustain the culture to create
a supportive environment for learning. This enables Merahans, both present
and past, to thrive and form lifelong friendships and contribute to the
community around us.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A school of Opportunities</strong>.
Our school has a range of customised programmes (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUypp35Jv44&amp;t=9s" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">corporate video</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIrTsU5YXAY" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open House video</a>) to develop and nurture Merahans to be Resilient,
Caring and Self-directed. A key feature of our instructional programme
is the use of feedback to help our students develop their thinking and
communication skills and take action to address their learning gaps. As
part of their BM student development experiences, activities from camping
activities, cross-cultural engagement and immersions to aesthetic appreciation
are organised to develop desired competencies such as collaboration, civic
consciousness and global literacy.</p>
<p>As we embark on new adventures in the new year, I would like to encourage
all Merahans, colleagues, parents and partners to stay committed not just
to our vision and values but to demonstrate and role model these consistently
through what we say and what we do. Small is beautiful. Each of us can
make a difference in making BM a school for the community.</p>

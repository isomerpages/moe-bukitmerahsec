However, we were hit by phases of Heightened Alert as well as the Delta and Omicron variants of the coronavirus. We are still adjusting to the new normal. Nevertheless, life has to go on.  I am proud to have witnessed our Merahans living up to the school value of ‘Resilience’ and pressed on tenaciously to conclude the academic year on a positive note. 2021 would be a year remembered for our various notable school achievements despite the ongoing pandemic.<br><br>The school theme for 2021 is that of ‘BM Stronger Together’. As Helen Keller once said, ‘Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much’. This is so true of the Merahan family, that we must stay united as one family. <br>Together as one Merahan family, we adhere closely to all Safe Management Measures so as to ensure that the school is a safe and conducive environment where we play, learn and interact together. Students were able to enjoy S.P.L.T. (Student-Play-Lead-inTeract) sessions. English Week and Mother Tongue Week were meaningfully conducted to promote the students’ passion in languages and cultures. eGMP (virtual twinning programme) was held successfully for the Secondary Three cohort and they were able to interact and engage in activities with their peers from the overseas twining schools via Zoom. <br>Together as one Merahan family, we officially opened the Galaxy, an engaging and inclusive infrastructure for Merahans to explore their passions and interact with their peers and teachers. The official opening was graced by our President, Her Excellency, Halimah Yacob. Students from the Resilient Merahan Programme (RMP) and Helping Our Merahans Excel (HOME) school initiatives had a wonderful opportunity to hold conversations and take memorable photographs with the President. <br>Together as one Merahan family, all the Performing Arts CCAs did the school proud at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. The Concert Band attained the Certificate of Distinction for the category of Percussion Ensemble, and the Certificate of Accomplishment for the category of Flexible Band. The Modern Dance troupe attained the Certificate of Distinction. The Drama Club attained the Certificate of Accomplishment. All these can only be achieved with the perseverance, passion and proficiency of all the students, teachers and coaches.<br>The school is fully onboard the nation-wide National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP). Every Secondary 1 to 3 student owns a Personal Learning Device (PLD) and this in turn spurs them on to be take ownership of their learning, participate in collaborative learning and extend their learning beyond the context of the classroom. Students engage in Blended Learning whereby Information Communication Technology (ICT) is weaved tightly with classroom learning and Home Based Learning (HBL). This resonates closely with our school vision that every Merahan is a self-directed learner.<br>I am indeed grateful for all the professionalism, ingenuity and dedication shown by each and every member of the teaching and administrative staff. Without their dedication and unwavering support, the academic year, despite the occasional storms, would not be as smooth sailing as it was. It was heartening to see the students striving to excel in their academic pursuit and character development. Every student matters and no one will be left behind. Only as one Merahan family can we truly be Stronger Together.<br>Despite all the uncertainties and hurdles, we are not without hope. We did our best to surmount our challenges and we will continue stoutly to do so. I look forward to a brighter and cheerier 2022. Every dawn brings new hopes and BMSS will continue to march on steadfastly and strongly in the new academic year. <br>BM Stronger Together!!<br><br>Mr Timothy Cheng<br><br>School Principal |

<p>In BM, our vision is to nurture our Merahans to be Resilient, Caring and
Self-directed Learners, anchored in our school values -- Respect, Integrity,
Self-discipline and Empathy (RISE), so they can contribute and make a difference
in the community we are in.</p>
<p>An enduring strength of our school is our caring and enabling environment.
The concerted effort of our Merahans, staff and stakeholders grow that
strength has made it possible for the school to develop customised school
programmes and contributed to the sustained achievements in terms of academic
progression and character development. This culminated in the school being
a proud recipient of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1aTejQPpXK/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in Uplifting Students</a> last
year.</p>
<p>While we may be small in population size, we are a school big in our character
development, hearts and opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Character Development</strong>:
Academic progression is important for Merahans but it alone does not define
their past, present and future. What is equally important is to anchor
our Merahans in good values so they can make informed and responsible decisions.
In BM, we endeavour to develop Merahans to RISE up to every occasion and
to consider not just themselves but the others around them. We are grateful
to the parents, partners and members of the public who affirmed Merahans
for their public spiritedness and conduct within and outside of the school.
We certainly hope our Merahans can continue to do what is right for years
to come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hearts</strong>: A trademark of
our school is our strong and positive culture of care among students, staff
and between students and staff. Regular opportunities are established to
grow and deepen the relationships that perpetuate the culture. The commitment
and dedication of our mission-driven staff, many of whom have served in
the school for decades, is a strong anchor to sustain the culture to create
a supportive environment for learning. This enables Merahans, both present
and past, to thrive and form lifelong friendships and contribute to the
community around us.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Opportunities for growth</strong>:
Our school has a range of customised programmes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUypp35Jv44" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">see corporate video</a>)
to develop and nurture Merahans to be Resilient, Caring and Self-directed.
A key feature of our instructional programme is the use of feedback to
help our students develop their thinking and communication skills and take
action to address their learning gaps. As part of their BM student development
experiences, activities from camping activities, cross-cultural engagement
and immersions to aesthetic appreciation are organised to develop desired
competencies such as adaptive thinking, collaboration and civic and global
literacies.</p>
<p>As we embark on new adventures in the new year, I would like to encourage
all Merahans, colleagues, parents and partners to stay committed not just
to our vision and values but to demonstrate and role model these consistently
through what we say and what we do. Each of us can make a difference in
making BM a school for the community. Small is beautiful.</p>

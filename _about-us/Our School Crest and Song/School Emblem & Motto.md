### School Emblem & Motto

 <img src="/images/bmsslogo.jpeg" style="width:20%">  
 
#### Crest & Badge


The School’s Crest and Badge are in the shape of a red triangle because the school is situated on a hill of red laterite. The lettering within the triangle incorporates the initials _“bm”_ for Bukit Merah, which is Malay for Red Hill. At the base of the initials is the school motto, “Sedia”, encapsulated in a flash. The flash leading upwards, indicates progress, steadfastness and sureness of the path taken to reach school goals and the cultivation of values that anchors Merahans for life.


#### Motto

The School’s Motto _“Sedia”_ means _“Always be Prepared”_.


#### Flag

 
The School Flag incorporates the School Crest. The main colours of the flag are navy blue and white. Navy blue, often featured in uniforms and formal wear, is associated with professionalism, stability and reliability. White, usually used to represent everything good and right, symbolises purity and respectability.

### School Song

<img src="/images/songpattern.png" style="width:80%">  
 
<figure> Youthful spirits are high and bright
<br>
BMSS is known far and wide
<br>
Tirelessly the teachers show the way
<br>
So firm, so loving, so sure to inspire
<br>
In school, no race nor creed that matters
<Br>
We mix, we play like brothers and sisters
<br>
Wisdom, virtue, fortitude
<Br>
Must not be found lacking
<Br>
Our love for our country, constant, everlasting
<Br>
Drum up our courage and spirits
<br>
Service to our community
<br>
Be loyal to our country
<br>
Be this our aim, be this our glory! </figure>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Huang Tao
<br><strong>Class:</strong> 4E2</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many lives in different ways the last
two years. When Huang Tao was in Secondary Three in 2021, the pandemic
seriously affected his parents’ business as they struggled to keep their
company afloat. Even though they closed down a few stores to cut losses,
his parents still found themselves in a dire financial situation. One Sunday
when his parents did not give Huang Tao his usual allowance for the week,
he thought they were busy and had forgotten. The boy did not ask because
he could tell that his parents seemed distracted, but when it happened
again and again in the next few weeks, Huang Tao knew that his parents
had to be facing severe financial difficulties. He decided that he would
take charge of his own allowance. He sold the one thing which he had painstakingly
saved his pocket money to buy - his bicycle. He calculated that if he was
prudent in spending his money, that sum should last him a few months. Such
resourcefulness and independence are characteristics of Huang Tao in all
aspects of his life.</p>
<p>Aware of his family’s high hopes for him to do well academically, Huang
Tao was determined to make them proud, especially his grandmother, by working
consistently to improve his studies. In particular, he began to read more
extensively and with greater intent to improve his English Language, which
he deemed to be one of his weaker subjects. First, he made a deliberate
effort to read for an hour before he went to bed every night. This led
to a marked improvement in his grades in English, and his English teacher
also noted his use of a wider range of vocabulary, well-constructed sentence
structures as well as greater coherence in his essays. His positive attitude
towards learning was also evident in the way he studied for all his other
subjects. He frequently sought consultation sessions with his subject teachers,
prepared with questions to clarify his doubts and further his understanding.
His determination and unflagging zeal throughout the last two years culminated
in a commendable achievement of 10 aggregate points for his L1R5 in his
‘O’ Levels preliminary examination in 2022.</p>
<p>While Huang Tao enjoys all kinds of sports, he was especially passionate
about playing basketball. His love for the game and his commitment to training
were exemplary - something that impressed his peers in the school team
and his coach who persuaded him to join a basketball club outside school
- Whye Nam Basketball Club. As vice-captain of the team, Huang Tao took
his leadership role seriously. During training, Huang Tao often led in
the warm-up exercises to ensure that his teammates were adequately prepared
before the actual games started. When training became intensive and even
gruesome in preparation for competitions, he was careful to exemplify resilience
and drive instead of giving in to fatigue and setbacks. In his free time,
Huang Tao also spent time playing basketball with junior members, seizing
every opportunity to hone their skills and help them develop sportsmanship
values of fair play, courage and perseverance. He displayed such values
whenever he played the game. In the 2022 National School B Division Basketball
(South Zone) Tournament, Huang Tao’s team went head-to-head with a team
that had beaten them all 4 prior games. Instead of feeling intimidated,
he encouraged his team to be bold and play their best regardless of the
strength of their opponents. In the end, his team fought off their doubts
and won the game with a lead of two points.</p>
<p>Balancing studies and basketball was not easy for Huang Tao. His parents
were skeptical about his ability to manage them well but time and again,
he showed by his consistent academic performance that he had the self-discipline
and determination to do well in both areas. Exuding confidence in most
circumstances, Huang Tao is able to interact well with everyone he meets.
While he develops strong bonds with his peers, he also maintains a close
circle of friends with whom he could connect deeper and confide in.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Javier Ng Kuan Yi
<br><strong>Class:</strong> 4N1</p>
<p>When Javier was first posted to Bukit Merah Secondary School as a Secondary
One student in the Normal Academic stream, he always knew he had a love
for Mathematics. Demonstrating the ability and positive attitude to cope
with the subject, Javier was offered the opportunity to take SBB and studied
Mathematics at the Express level by June that year.</p>
<p>It was not easy taking Mathematics at a more demanding level and Javier
often had to work harder and put in the extra hours to keep up with the
demands of the subject. But Javier never gave up. By working with his peers
who were also taking SBB Mathematics, Javier learnt the value of teamwork
and resilience. They would discuss questions together and teach one another.
Through regular consultations with his teachers and good routines at home,
Javier learnt to manage his time to do well in his studies without sacrificing
his mental well-being.</p>
<p>The opportunity to take SBB Mathematics has been a rewarding journey for
Javier as he continually challenged himself to do his best. “My friends
called me crazy when they heard that I was going to take Additional Mathematics
at Sec 3,” Javier recalled this incident as he reflected on his SBB journey.
Despite doing well in Lower Secondary Mathematics, Javier initially struggled
to cope with Additional Mathematics in Sec 3. Placed in a classroom with
new peers he did not know, Javier built a strong network of peer support
very quickly by being there and rallying for his classmates whenever he
could. Demonstrating a humble and positive learning attitude whenever he
asked his classmates for help in Mathematics, Javier soon inspired many
of his peers to help one another and contributed to a positive learning
climate in the classroom. His resilience and hard work eventually paid
off as he finally saw progress in his Additional Mathematics when he began
passing the tests and exams.</p>
<p>Javier’s love for Mathematics is infectious and inspiring to his peers,
including his classmates from the Normal Academic level. Ever so often,
Javier would spend his free time coaching his peers who were weaker in
Mathematics and share tips and strategies on how to solve Mathematics problems.</p>
<p>“Mathematics explains many things around us.” Inspired by his father,
Javier is very passionate about mechanics and electronics and sees the
relevance of Mathematics in every-day life. Having taken Mathematics at
a more challenging level, Javier is confident about his strengths and now
has more choices for his post-secondary options. He has accepted the offer
to enrol in the Mechatronics &amp; Robotics course at ITE via the Early
Admission Exercise. He hopes to inspire his peers and juniors to believe
in their own strengths and to do their very best to get to where they want
to be.</p>

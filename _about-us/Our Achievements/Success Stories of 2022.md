<p><strong>Name:</strong> Huang Tao
<br><strong>Class:</strong> 4E2</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many lives in different ways the last
two years. When Huang Tao was in Secondary Three in 2021, the pandemic
seriously affected his parents’ business as they struggled to keep their
company afloat. Even though they closed down a few stores to cut losses,
his parents still found themselves in a dire financial situation. One Sunday
when his parents did not give Huang Tao his usual allowance for the week,
he thought they were busy and had forgotten. The boy did not ask because
he could tell that his parents seemed distracted, but when it happened
again and again in the next few weeks, Huang Tao knew that his parents
had to be facing severe financial difficulties. He decided that he would
take charge of his own allowance. He sold the one thing which he had painstakingly
saved his pocket money to buy - his bicycle. He calculated that if he was
prudent in spending his money, that sum should last him a few months. Such
resourcefulness and independence are characteristics of Huang Tao in all
aspects of his life.</p>
<p>Aware of his family’s high hopes for him to do well academically, Huang
Tao was determined to make them proud, especially his grandmother, by working
consistently to improve his studies. In particular, he began to read more
extensively and with greater intent to improve his English Language, which
he deemed to be one of his weaker subjects. First, he made a deliberate
effort to read for an hour before he went to bed every night. This led
to a marked improvement in his grades in English, and his English teacher
also noted his use of a wider range of vocabulary, well-constructed sentence
structures as well as greater coherence in his essays. His positive attitude
towards learning was also evident in the way he studied for all his other
subjects. He frequently sought consultation sessions with his subject teachers,
prepared with questions to clarify his doubts and further his understanding.
His determination and unflagging zeal throughout the last two years culminated
in a commendable achievement of 10 aggregate points for his L1R5 in his
‘O’ Levels preliminary examination in 2022.</p>
<p>While Huang Tao enjoys all kinds of sports, he was especially passionate
about playing basketball. His love for the game and his commitment to training
were exemplary - something that impressed his peers in the school team
and his coach who persuaded him to join a basketball club outside school
- Whye Nam Basketball Club. As vice-captain of the team, Huang Tao took
his leadership role seriously. During training, Huang Tao often led in
the warm-up exercises to ensure that his teammates were adequately prepared
before the actual games started. When training became intensive and even
gruesome in preparation for competitions, he was careful to exemplify resilience
and drive instead of giving in to fatigue and setbacks. In his free time,
Huang Tao also spent time playing basketball with junior members, seizing
every opportunity to hone their skills and help them develop sportsmanship
values of fair play, courage and perseverance. He displayed such values
whenever he played the game. In the 2022 National School B Division Basketball
(South Zone) Tournament, Huang Tao’s team went head-to-head with a team
that had beaten them all 4 prior games. Instead of feeling intimidated,
he encouraged his team to be bold and play their best regardless of the
strength of their opponents. In the end, his team fought off their doubts
and won the game with a lead of two points.</p>
<p>Balancing studies and basketball was not easy for Huang Tao. His parents
were skeptical about his ability to manage them well but time and again,
he showed by his consistent academic performance that he had the self-discipline
and determination to do well in both areas. Exuding confidence in most
circumstances, Huang Tao is able to interact well with everyone he meets.
While he develops strong bonds with his peers, he also maintains a close
circle of friends with whom he could connect deeper and confide in.</p>

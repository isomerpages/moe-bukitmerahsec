<p><strong>Name:</strong> ZACH ANG KIAN PHONG, 洪建峰
<br><strong>Class: 5N1</strong>
</p>
<p>Zach embodies sheer tenacity and unwavering determination. Enrolled as
an N(T) student in Bukit Merah Secondary School, he was motivated by a
vision and pursued academic excellence relentlessly. In Sec 1, Zach was
offered N(A)-Level Chinese and English and he worked hard to be offered
N(A)-Level Mathematics in the middle of Sec 1. His journey, anchored on
hard work, helped him secure a lateral transfer to N(A) in Sec 2.</p>
<p>Guided by his teachers' unwavering belief in him, Zach set his sights
on broader academic goals. His aspirations to delve into a polytechnic's
common business programme stem from a profound desire to explore diverse
business facets, broadening his perspective before focusing on a specialisation
in year two. Zach also took up the Advanced Elective Module on Fundamentals
of Entrepreneurship offered by Singapore Polytechnic to learn more about
post-secondary course options during the June vacation in 2023 and obtained
a Pass with Commendation.</p>
<p>Beyond studies, Zach has a vibrant passion for sports. From bowling since
the tender age of 5 to representing his primary school basketball team,
sportsmanship runs deep within him. In Bukit Merah Secondary School, Zach
initially wanted to join the floorball CCA, to expand on his sporting repertoire.
However, he was absent from school during the floorball selection trial
as he had to attend to his grandfather’s passing in Vietnam. As such, he
was assigned to basketball, which was not his first choice. Nevertheless,
he seized the chance to continue to work on his basketball skills and developed
the strong friendship and camaraderie he forged with his fellow peers.
He trained hard for his role as a forward with the team and coordinated
well with his teammates. In 2019 and 2022, he was chosen to represent the
school in the National School Games Basketball Championships 'C' and 'B'
Divisions respectively. He also played an integral role in the T-Net Under-14
Invitational Basketball Tournament and the ActiveSG Basketball competitions
in 2019. Outside of school, Zach excels in bowling, winning the National
University of Singapore Society Division 1 in 2020, and Divisions 2 and
3 in 2021.</p>
<p>Leadership found him when he least expected it. Identified for his potential
by his Sec 1 Form Teacher, Zach assumed roles as a Prefect (Sec 2-4) and
later as Class Chairperson (Sec 5), instilling in him a profound sense
of service and responsibility. As a Prefect, he demonstrated commitment
and dedication and was involved in many school events such as the Secondary
One Orientation where he led his juniors in getting to know the school
and in building their class identity. He also participated in the school
Science, Arts and Mathematics Festival (SAMFest), a publicity outreach
programme for primary schools, as a student facilitator who acquainted
primary school students with life in secondary school through experiential
learning. Zach also continued to serve in a leadership role in 2023 as
the Class Chairperson, supporting his class in the development of a strong
class culture. These experiences crystallized his understanding of collaboration,
resilience, and initiative, invaluable traits for his envisioned pursuit
in business studies.</p>
<p>His benevolent spirit radiates through his community endeavours. From
volunteering during school holidays as a table official for basketball
matches to championing anti-bullying campaigns in school and assisting
the less privileged during festive seasons by packing and delivering Chinese
New Year goodies bags for the residents of Redhill Moral Senior Activity
Centre, Zach's commitment to contribute to the community is resolute. His
involvement in Play Inclusive with ASPN Tanglin School students where he
conducted virtual sessions with ASPN Tanglin students over zoom during
the challenges of the pandemic underscored his dedication to inclusivity
and service.</p>
<p>Though Zach never got to experience FSBB, he was able to take higher level
subjects in Sec 1 through the SBB. Reflecting on the FSBB mixed form class
provision, Zach envisions its potential to dissolve course barriers, fostering
a rich tapestry of friendships and peer support, ultimately enhancing collaborative
learning through diverse strengths.</p>
<p>Zach's journey epitomizes the extraordinary capacity of determination,
leadership, and altruism. His story is a testament to the value of resilience,
service, and unity, and is exemplary of how an indomitable human spirit
can shape a future.</p>

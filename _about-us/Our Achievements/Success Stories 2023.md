</div>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> ZACH ANG KIAN PHONG, 洪建峰
<br><strong>Class: 5N1</strong>
</p>
<p>Zach embodies sheer tenacity and unwavering determination. Enrolled as
an N(T) student in Bukit Merah Secondary School, he was motivated by a
vision and pursued academic excellence relentlessly. In Sec 1, Zach was
offered N(A)-Level Chinese and English and he worked hard to be offered
N(A)-Level Mathematics in the middle of Sec 1. His journey, anchored on
hard work, helped him secure a lateral transfer to N(A) in Sec 2.</p>
<p>Guided by his teachers' unwavering belief in him, Zach set his sights
on broader academic goals. His aspirations to delve into a polytechnic's
common business programme stem from a profound desire to explore diverse
business facets, broadening his perspective before focusing on a specialisation
in year two. Zach also took up the Advanced Elective Module on Fundamentals
of Entrepreneurship offered by Singapore Polytechnic to learn more about
post-secondary course options during the June vacation in 2023 and obtained
a Pass with Commendation.</p>
<p>Beyond studies, Zach has a vibrant passion for sports. From bowling since
the tender age of 5 to representing his primary school basketball team,
sportsmanship runs deep within him. In Bukit Merah Secondary School, Zach
initially wanted to join the floorball CCA, to expand on his sporting repertoire.
However, he was absent from school during the floorball selection trial
as he had to attend to his grandfather’s passing in Vietnam. As such, he
was assigned to basketball, which was not his first choice. Nevertheless,
he seized the chance to continue to work on his basketball skills and developed
the strong friendship and camaraderie he forged with his fellow peers.
He trained hard for his role as a forward with the team and coordinated
well with his teammates. In 2019 and 2022, he was chosen to represent the
school in the National School Games Basketball Championships 'C' and 'B'
Divisions respectively. He also played an integral role in the T-Net Under-14
Invitational Basketball Tournament and the ActiveSG Basketball competitions
in 2019. Outside of school, Zach excels in bowling, winning the National
University of Singapore Society Division 1 in 2020, and Divisions 2 and
3 in 2021.</p>
<p>Leadership found him when he least expected it. Identified for his potential
by his Sec 1 Form Teacher, Zach assumed roles as a Prefect (Sec 2-4) and
later as Class Chairperson (Sec 5), instilling in him a profound sense
of service and responsibility. As a Prefect, he demonstrated commitment
and dedication and was involved in many school events such as the Secondary
One Orientation where he led his juniors in getting to know the school
and in building their class identity. He also participated in the school
Science, Arts and Mathematics Festival (SAMFest), a publicity outreach
programme for primary schools, as a student facilitator who acquainted
primary school students with life in secondary school through experiential
learning. Zach also continued to serve in a leadership role in 2023 as
the Class Chairperson, supporting his class in the development of a strong
class culture. These experiences crystallized his understanding of collaboration,
resilience, and initiative, invaluable traits for his envisioned pursuit
in business studies.</p>
<p>His benevolent spirit radiates through his community endeavours. From
volunteering during school holidays as a table official for basketball
matches to championing anti-bullying campaigns in school and assisting
the less privileged during festive seasons by packing and delivering Chinese
New Year goodies bags for the residents of Redhill Moral Senior Activity
Centre, Zach's commitment to contribute to the community is resolute. His
involvement in Play Inclusive with ASPN Tanglin School students where he
conducted virtual sessions with ASPN Tanglin students over zoom during
the challenges of the pandemic underscored his dedication to inclusivity
and service.</p>
<p>Though Zach never got to experience FSBB, he was able to take higher level
subjects in Sec 1 through the SBB. Reflecting on the FSBB mixed form class
provision, Zach envisions its potential to dissolve course barriers, fostering
a rich tapestry of friendships and peer support, ultimately enhancing collaborative
learning through diverse strengths.</p>
<p>Zach's journey epitomizes the extraordinary capacity of determination,
leadership, and altruism. His story is a testament to the value of resilience,
service, and unity, and is exemplary of how an indomitable human spirit
can shape a future.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> KUAH KAI ERN, KAYDEN, 柯凯恩
<br><strong>Class: 4E1</strong>
</p>
<p>Kayden’s journey stands as a testament to the power of finding the perfect
environment to blossom and thrive, even in the most unexpected corners.
It is also a story about the strong culture of care and support in Bukit
Merah Secondary School.</p>
<p>In his earlier years, Kayden envisioned himself in a secondary school
with robust academic programmes. However, when reality didn’t align with
those dreams post-PSLE, he found himself stranded. But in that uncertainty,
an unexpected visit to Bukit Merah Secondary School changed everything.</p>
<p>Welcomed warmly by the staff who were in the school when he visited on
a random weekday, Kayden felt an instant connection with the school. The
nurturing atmosphere evoked in him a sense of care and security, sealing
his decision to consider our school as a viable choice. It was not just
about academic pursuit; it was about the palpable authenticity that resonated
with him.</p>
<p>Within this supportive environment, Kayden flourished. Through innovative
programs like Self-Initiated Learning (SIL), he explored his interests.
From delving into video game programming in Sec 2 to authoring a book that
was sparked by his fascination with the clash of cultures in Sec 4, he
found his voice and his confidence. In 2023, Kayden, tapping on ChatGPT,
authored the book “Bernard’s Mission”, which is available on Kindle as
an e-book and paperback. In the pages of his book, the encounter between
two distinct cultures in the vastness of outer space culminated in a narrative
about overcoming challenges and discovering harmony through peace. It epitomises
Kayden’s personal expedition within the school's walls.</p>
<p>In his earlier years, Kayden was reserved and introspective. Yet, within
the nurturing embrace of the school’s safe and caring environment, a remarkable
transformation occurred. He found his voice, his confidence blossomed,
and he integrated seamlessly into a vibrant tapestry of classmates, peers,
and even juniors. Much like the story he penned, where differences converged
and common ground is found, Kayden’s own journey reflects a beautiful narrative
of growth, resilience, and the triumph of growth over barriers. The supportive
atmosphere of the school became the catalyst for his evolution from being
an introvert to a confident individual, at ease in his interactions and
connections.</p>
<p>Expanding beyond self-directed learning facilitated by the school, Kayden
delved deeply into his passion for Principles of Accounts (POA). Through
the school’s stretch programme, he seized the opportunity to participate
in the 2023 POA Quest competition hosted by Deyi Secondary School. Through
unwavering teamwork and dedication, Kayden and his team achieved the remarkable
feat of emerging as the ultimate champions!</p>
<p>Kayden’s leadership spark shone brightly through his roles in the Drama
Club CCA's Executive Committee in 2023 and as the Class Chairperson in
2021 and 2023. In 2023, he spearheaded his class’s organisation of the
school's celebrated "Free Day," where students take the reins in planning
activities, backed by the school’s support. After gathering opinions from
his peers, Kayden and his team orchestrated an enriching trip to the National
Museum. The trip was particularly memorable and showcases the essence of
home-school partnership when his mother made an unexpected appearance at
the museum as she wanted to support Kayden’s initiative.</p>
<p>Kayden has earned a coveted place in Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Diploma in
Common Business Programme through the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE ).
His success in this endeavour is a testament to several crucial elements:
the opportunities provided by the school to develop his interest in POA
and leadership competencies, the nurturing environment that allowed his
entrepreneurial spirit to flourish, culminating in the publication of his
book, and deployment of teachers to mentor and support Sec 4&amp;5 students
interested to pursue EAE. Kayden’s mentor was his form teacher, Mrs. Ng,
whose support for him during the process was unwavering.</p>
<p>Despite the daily travel of an hour, Kayden cherishes the enriching experiences,
lasting friendships, and the immense growth he found within our school
walls. It is not just a commute; it is a journey towards a future brimming
with confidence and possibilities. Kayden’s story stands as a testament
that the right environment can transform aspirations into reality, no matter
where the path begins.</p>

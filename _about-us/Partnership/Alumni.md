**Bukit Merah Secondary School Alumni**

We are pleased to announce the formation of Bukit Merah Secondary School’s Alumni. Officially incorporated in December 2020, our Alumni is an organization where you can establish meaningful networks as you continue to nurture precious relationships built from your alma mater and cherish shared experiences.

Many Merahans have passed through the school gates since 1968 after experiencing some of the best formative years of our lives. We received a solid education that opened our minds, forged lasting friendships, and imbibed values that still influence us now. Even as we have all moved on with our further education and respective careers, our memories of time spent at Bukit Merah Secondary School still tugs at our heartstrings. For many of us, the sense of belonging remains.

The Bukit Merah Secondary School Alumni aims to serve as an anchor for this sense of belonging.

The Alumni committee welcomes current final year students and all past BMSS students to join the Bukit Merah Secondary School Alumni by signing up at [https://go.gov.sg/bmss-alumni-registration](https://go.gov.sg/bmss-alumni-registration)

Membership fee is currently waived and you can look forward to reconnect through diverse projects and gatherings as well as get to know fellow Merahans. So do sign up and let us all come together to build a strong and active Alumni!

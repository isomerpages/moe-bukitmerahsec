#### What is DSA-Sec?


Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec) allows students to apply to some schools before taking the PSLE.

Students apply based on their talent in sports, CCAs and specific academic areas.

If your child is admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec, they are not allowed to:

*   Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.
*   Transfer to another school. They must commit to their chosen school for the duration of the programme.

#### Who can apply


Primary 6 students can apply for DSA-Sec based on a wide-range of talents, including:

*   Sports and games
*   Visual, literary and performing arts
*   Debate and public speaking
*   Science, mathematics and engineering
*   Languages and humanities
*   Uniformed groups
*   Leadership (for example, prefects)

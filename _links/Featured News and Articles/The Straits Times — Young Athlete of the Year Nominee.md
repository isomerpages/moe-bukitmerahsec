### The Straits Times — Young Athlete of the Year Nominee

John Alicante Embile was an integral member of the 2018 Floorball ‘B’ Division team that clinched the championship. In the finals, during the tense penalty shoot-out with the score tied at 6-6, John took the winning penalty shot under tremendous pressure.

We will like to congratulate John who managed to clinch the ST Young Star Award as well as being nominated for the Young Athlete of the Year. Continue to soar greater heights, John!

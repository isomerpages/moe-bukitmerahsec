### Racial Harmony Day 2020 

This year, BMSS celebrated Racial Harmony Day by understanding different cultures in Singapore virtually, with safe distancing measures in place. Through food, students learned about the nuances of each cultural subgroup, so as to expand their appreciation of our diversity.

Back in class, students got to discuss, learn more about one another’s cultures and record their findings in videos. Good videos will be compiled to showcase BMSS’ appreciation of Singapore’s rich cultural diversity!

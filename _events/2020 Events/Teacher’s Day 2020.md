### Teacher’s Day 2020 

_“A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stop.” – Henry Brooks Adams_

Bukit Merah Secondary School celebrates Teacher’s Day 2020 with creative uses of technology! Our teachers let their hairs down for the day and watched an entertaining e-concert, took part in game quizzes prepared by the students and received words of appreciation from our Merahans!

To all staff in Bukit Merah Secondary School, Happy Teacher’s Day!

### Release of 2019 O Levels Results 

<img src="/images/olevels1.png" style="width:80%">

The release of the GCE ‘O’ Level results took place on Monday 13 January 2020. Our 2019 4E5N students did our school proud and collected their results. It was an important milestone for our resilient Merahans as many were overjoyed in reaping the fruits of their labour. We awarded 6 students as our ‘Resilient Achievers’. This recognition showcased students who overcame difficult challenges in their life to attain academic excellence through sheer hard work and perseverance.

We are delighted to celebrate the achievements of all our Merahans as they have personified our school values of Respect, Integrity, Self-discipline and Empathy!

Congratulations to our 2019 4E5N cohort and we wish them all the best as they embark on the next phase of their lives!

### Secondary Two eCamp 2020

On 22 October 2020, our Secondary Two students went through the Bukit Merah Secondary School inaugural E-Camp!

They experienced a day of fun through our inter-class challenge competed within their classes and took part in activities such as healthy mobile gaming, water colouring, Lego coding and even K-Pop dance sessions. A virtual campfire rounded off a wonderful day!

Happy Holidays!

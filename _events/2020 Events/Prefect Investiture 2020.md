The Prefects’ Investiture is an important ceremony during which the prefects from the graduating levels are recognised for their years of service to the school as well as their role as mentors to the junior prefects. The ceremony also marks the handing over of the reins of leadership to a new Executive Committee. In light of the COVID-19 situation, this year’s Prefects’ Investiture was conducted via an online platform and was streamed to the classes during the assembly slot on 7th July.

Congratulations to the newly appointed Executive Committee as they venture forth on their leadership journey.

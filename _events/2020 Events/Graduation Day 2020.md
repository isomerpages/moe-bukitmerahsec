### Graduation Day 2020

In the past week, our Secondary 4/5 students celebrated their Graduation Day. We held an E-Ceremony where our Upper Secondary Year Head Ms Stella Toh presented each class with their very own BMSS Bears as a gift to remember the school by. We traced their journey with a lookback to their journey as a Merahan in a touching montage. Lastly, classes spent valuable time with their form teachers and friends.

To all Secondary 4/5 students, all the best for your national examinations!

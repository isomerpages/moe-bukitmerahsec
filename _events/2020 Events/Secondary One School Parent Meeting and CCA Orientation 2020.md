### Secondary One School Parent Meeting and CCA Orientation 2020 

On 11 January 2020, our school hosted our Secondary 1 and their parents to our Secondary 1 Parent-Teacher Meeting and CCA Orientation. Our Concert Band and Modern Dance Club put up a performance for our guests as they interacted with our school leaders and teachers. After the breakfast session, students and parents were invited to walk around CCA booths to learn more about our vibrant CCA life in BMSS!

A big thanks to all parents who took time out of their busy schedule to join us!

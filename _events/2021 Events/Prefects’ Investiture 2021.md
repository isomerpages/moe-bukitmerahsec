30th March 2021 was a proud day for members of the BMSS Prefectorial Board as it marked the appointment of the prefects and the new executive committee. During her speech, the incoming Head Prefect, Natalie Chow, shared the initiatives that the prefects will introduce in the upcoming year, including the launch of the Student Suggestion Scheme. To our Merahans, we look forward to receiving your suggestions. Do take this opportunity to make BMSS an even better place for all!

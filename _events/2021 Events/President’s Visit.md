### President’s Visit

To some of our students, the last school bell used to mean that it is time to go home and wait till the next day for exciting lessons and fun times with teachers and friends. With our Resilient Merahan Programme (RMP) and Helping Our Merahans Excel (HoME) programme, students now have a safe and inclusive place in school during after school hours to explore their passions and interact with their peers and teachers.

To have this opportunity to introduce our after-school engagement programmes to President Halimah Yacob is nothing less than a dream come true for our students and staff!

We are tremendously honoured to spend the afternoon with Mdm President and to present our gift “Illuminate” – a DIY lamp to symbolise how BMSS lights up our students’ lives and helps them to soar to greater heights.

Thank you Mdm President for gracing and officiating the opening of The Galaxy – the latest addition to our school campus for our Merahans! We are confident that this will be one of our students’ favourite places in school. 😊

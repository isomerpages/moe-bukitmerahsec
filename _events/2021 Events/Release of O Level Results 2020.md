Our 2020 O Level cohort collected their results for the national examinations today. Our heartiest congratulations to all the well-deserved successes of our Merahans! 2020 was a significant year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Merahans persevered and remained resilient during such a difficult period, adapting to new norms and managing their revision from home. Their hard work paid off as many students celebrated the fruits of their labour and were euphoric when they received their certificates and results from the teachers. We are extremely proud of all our students who have worked hard and done the school proud. 

To our Merahans who are embarking on a new journey after O Levels, we want to wish you all the best and cheer  you on in your future endeavours. Always remember, ‘Once a Merahan, Always a Merahan!’

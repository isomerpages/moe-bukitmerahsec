### 1st SPLT Session in 2021 

Our weekly Students. Play. Lead. InTeract (sPLT) session started today with a bang! Our Merahans have been waiting in anticipation for this day when they are able to begin the school day with their choice of activity ranging from indoors board games and talent showcases to outdoors physical sports and competitons. And they definitely had memorable and meaningful play experiences this morning!

We believe that our students and teachers are able to have fun in these engaging acitivites and come closer together as a Merahan family.

What would you hope to play, lead and inspire other Merahans with during the next sPLT session? We are already looking forward to our next session on the coming Wednesday! ðŸ˜Š

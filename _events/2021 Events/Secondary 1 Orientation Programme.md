###  Secondary 1 Orientation Programme 

Starting a new year in an unfamiliar school can be daunting for many, but our Secondary One Orientation Programme ensured that everyone enjoyed the first week with new friendships and connections to the Merahan family. Spanning over three days, our Secondary One students bonded with their Form Teachers and classmates over breakfast and games. Our friendly prefects played a vital role in helping the Secondary One students to settle in by conducting ice breaker activities and bringing them on a school tour. Entering a new phase of their lives, the Secondary One students also attended a Transition workshop and picked up essential skills to adjust to the secondary school life.

The last day of the Orientation Programme ended on a high note. The enthusiasm and creativity of our Secondary One students were evident from the finale performances on the last day. Well done to all Secondary One students!

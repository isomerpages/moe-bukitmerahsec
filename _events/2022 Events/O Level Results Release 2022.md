Our 2021 O-Level cohort collected their results for the national examinations this week. The heartiest congratulations to our Merahans who have completed the GCE O-Level examination. The hard work and effort put in by our Merahans and teachers have paid off! We are very proud of all Merahans who persevered and worked hard to achieve their goals.

To our Merahans who are embarking on a new journey after the O-Levels, we wish you all the best and cheer you on in your future endeavours.

Dear Parents/Guardian,

In BMSS, we believe that it takes a village to raise a child and would like to work closely with you to support and develop your child holistically.

As such, we are organising a virtual Parent-Teacher Meeting (PTM) on 15 January 2022, Saturday, to share with you more about our level outcomes and programmes. It is also a good opportunity for you to meet your child’s/ward’s Form Teachers.

The programme for the virtual PTM is as follows:

9.00 am – Sharing of level programmes by Year Head + Sharing of Personalised Digital Learning Programme by HOD/ICT

9.40 am – Question and Answer Session

9.50 am – Interaction with Form Teachers as a class

10.30 am – End of Sessions

The zoom access details have been made available via Parents Gateway or Sec 1 Allocation Portal ([https://go.gov.sg/bms1allocationportal](https://go.gov.sg/bms1allocationportal)).

Thank you and see you virtual on Saturday.

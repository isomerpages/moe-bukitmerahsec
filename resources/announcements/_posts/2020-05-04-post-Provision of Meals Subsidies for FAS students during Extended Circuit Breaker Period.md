The Circuit Breaker period is now extended by another 4 weeks to 1 June 2020, and the mid-year school break will be advanced to May. Typically, meal subsidies are not provided during school holidays. However, given the exceptional circumstances this year, together with the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), MOE has decided to continue providing meal subsidies through School Smartcard top-ups during this mid-year holidays. This is on top of the provision of school meal subsidies that MOE and the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) had provided earlier, in the form of School Smartcard top-ups to all Primary and Secondary students from low income families during the period of Full Home-Based Learning.
